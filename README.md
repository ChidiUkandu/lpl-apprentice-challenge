This was an interesting task for me to complete due to my lack of exposure to React.js and Github APIs. 

For this challenge, my approach was to first figure out how to handle the information from the Github APIs. It was decided to use the attributes stargazers_count, Forks, issues, and description for the table. 
-UseState was used to obtain theses attributes from the frameworks
-multiple API requests were made through the use of axios.all

For the table, I used basic html and populated through the use of previously created constants.
