# Framework Evaluator

## Getting Started

This project contains an API service class out of the box to make it easier to interact with the GitHub API. This is located in [`./api/api.js`](./api/api.js). If you find that this does not meet your needs, you can pull in another third-party library or use fetch directly.

Good luck!
